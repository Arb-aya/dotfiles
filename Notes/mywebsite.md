Website ideas:


-----
GAME
-----

Bot and website to interact:
	- Bot to query database via API (fastapi)

- Users to be able to use their twitch account to login (via allauth) [done]

- Users can choose from a list of characters and upgrade certain stats.
	- HP
	- MP
	- Agility - speed across the screen
	- Dexterity - change to dodge attacks
	- Strength - affect dealt

	- Users can choose appearance from a number limited options

	- Classes?
		- Rogue
		- Fighter
		- Mage
		- Archer

	- Why have classes? They could have different abilities that trigger as a "special attack".


-----
BLOG
-----

Be able to publish posts.
	- Django can publish markdown with template filters.

Have people comment on them if they so desire.



----
SHOP
----

Users can spend points on items for their characters.

* Use stripe to buy more points with real money. But then remove this feature after project has been marked.

---
POINTS

Presuming we reach affiliate and people decide to sub:
	- earn more points for subs
