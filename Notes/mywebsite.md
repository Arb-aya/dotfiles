TODO:

 * Inventory.js
	- filters: By slot / By type

 * make display character form look better at bigger responsive breakpoints

 * Finish styling forms: namely buttons.

Potential bugs/features?
	Sometimes when saving changes to the traits, the new value is saved incorrectly (namely as the number of points spent, rather than the default value + number of points spent). Haven't been able to reproduce this yet. Happened with the MP trait.

Bot and website to interact:
	- Bot to query database via API (fastapi)

- Users to be able to use their twitch account to login (via allauth) [done]

- Users can choose from a list of characters and upgrade certain stats.
	- HP
	- MP
	- Agility - speed across the screen
	- Dexterity - change to dodge attacks
	- Strength - affect dealt

	- Users can choose appearance from a number limited options

	- Classes?
		- Rogue
		- Fighter
		- Mage
		- Archer

	- Why have classes? They could have different abilities that trigger as a "special attack".
